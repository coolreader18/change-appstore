# HBAS Repository Changer
An [HBL](https://github.com/dimok789/homebrew_launcher) app to change the repository that the [Homebrew Appstore](https://github.com/vgmoose/hbas) references.
## Installation
Drop the wiiu folder into the root of your sd card. Requires homebrew launcher and is pointless without the appstore. Completely clueless? Go [here](https://wiiu.guide). It's not necessary to do all of it, for this you can stop after the homebrew launcher.
## Usage
Click the button corresponding to the repository you want to choose.
## Credit
Uses rw-r-r-0644's [HelloWorld-Easy](https://github.com/rw-r-r-0644/WiiU-HelloWorld-Easy) library.
